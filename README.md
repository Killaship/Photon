# Photon
Photon is a minimalist bootloader for my OS, called Codename Spectrum.


# Use ```bash build.sh``` to build the bootloader.
As of right now, the bootloader releases do not come with anything to load, so later on I will provide instructions to combine a kernel and the bootloader, and possibly add a placeholder "Hello, World" kernel.
